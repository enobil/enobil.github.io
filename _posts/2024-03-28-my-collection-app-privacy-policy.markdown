Effective Date: 2024-03-28

This privacy policy ("Policy") describes how "My Collection" (the "Application") collects, uses, and manages your information. The Application is committed to protecting the privacy of its users ("you" or "your") and handles all personal data in accordance with this Policy.

# 1. Information Collection and Use
The Application is designed to store items in your collection and manage their rotation for your personal use ("Service"). The Application does not require or collect any personal information from you. All data entered into the Application, including but not limited to, item details, descriptions, and images, are stored locally on your device and are not uploaded to any servers or cloud services.

# 2. Local Storage
The Application stores all user-entered data locally on your device. This data includes any information you input to manage your collection within the Application. As the data is stored locally, you are responsible for the security of your device. The Application does not access, upload, or share your data with any third parties.

# 3. No Sensitive Information
The Application does not request, collect, or access any sensitive personal information, such as your name, contact information, passwords, or any other personally identifying details. The Application solely focuses on providing the Service as described without the need for such information.

# 4. Security
We take reasonable steps to protect the information that is stored within your device. However, as no electronic storage method or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, we cannot ensure or warrant the absolute security of any information you store within the Application.

# 5. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.
